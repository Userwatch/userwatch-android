# Userwatch Android Client Library

Userwatch is a service to help turn repeat signups and account sharers into
paying customers, while keeping bad actors out. Learn more about it at
[userwat.ch](https://userwat.ch). Userwatch is currently in beta release.

This library is for integrating Userwatch smarts into your Android
Application. It is currently intended to be used with Kotlin or Java code,
via the Maven Central Repository, but you may have luck with other setups.
